## edge cases not handled yet
- clicking off subtractive or aetherhues or monochrome tones (not possible in game)
- aetherhues expiring off mid-cast (should work but need to text)
- hammer expiring (will maintain combo into next hammer usage)
- hyperphantasia expiring mid-cast should not give rainbow bright (haven't tested)
- explain CDH "effective potency" conversion
- second, staggered starry muse in the party
